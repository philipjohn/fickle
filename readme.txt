Randomise your blog's description, simply.

== Description ==

Specify multiple blog taglines and let this plugin randomly choose which one to show.

Simply go to Settings > General and in the Tagline box separate your taglines with a pipe ("|") character.

It is possible to change the separator from a pip to something else. Add this to your functions.php, replacing the pipe with your character of choice;
`define( 'RANDOM_TAGLINE_SEP', '|' );`

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= WTF is WTFPL? =

Why bother with the GPL when it limits use? WTFPL says you can do "What The Fuck you like" with this plugin. Print it on bedsheets and sleep with it for all I care.
